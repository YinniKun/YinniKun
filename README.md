My name is Richard and currently is a PhD student at the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. I got my Bachelor of Science in Medical Physics, Biology, and Bioinformatics from the University of Waterloo, and I am interested in using computational and mathematical approaches to unveil mysteries in cancer.
