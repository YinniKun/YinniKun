My name is Richard and currently I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. I am a member of the Schwartz Lab at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and work on computational machine learning models to understand cancer heterogeneity in order to achieve better radiation treatment results. I got my Bachelor of Science in Medical Physics, Biology, and Bioinformatics from the University of Waterloo.
